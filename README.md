1. Set up your system. Create a main folder with the following subfolders: "sequences", "results", "images", "databases", "evolview", "compara", "hmm", and "orthologs".
2. 5. and run the binary hmmsearch on your downloaded Ensembl data. Save the result file in mainfolder/hmm, preferably [fileidentifier]_hmmsearch.txt. (e.g. 150602-SM00355-xtro_hmmsearch.fasta). 


## 0. Before you start...
1. Download your data: protein sequences from Ensembl Biomart ([Ensembl](http://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview/0fea912a097e984e080910d0e481bc04), [Metazoa](http://metazoa.ensembl.org/biomart/martview/41b7027ad573051d5ae6042363b08980), [Plants](http://plants.ensembl.org/biomart/martview/8e64fd02b779de836a8ad9e145548997), [Protists](http://protists.ensembl.org/biomart/martview/85097007194679c2b70acd1ceb4b668b)), ensuring that the fasta headers consist of (in this order) >geneID|genename|proteinID. Download as a zipped file, and make sure that the filename starts with a four character species specification. Optional: use the filter for SMART-domain 'SM00355' on the data prior to download.
2. Save all data in a single folder inside a main folder.
3. Download [HMMer](http://hmmer.org/) and the [C2H2 Pfam model](http://pfam.xfam.org/family/PF00096/hmm) (via [Pfam]( http://pfam.xfam.org/family/PF00096)). Save the binary and model in a second folder inside the main folder.
4. Customize **config.py** to contain the path to your main folder, the folder with downloaded ensembl data, the path to the hmm binaries and pfam model, and a list of the species you downloaded from ensembl (in 'sppall'). If you downloaded data from the main Ensembl (i.e. not Metazoa, Plants, or Protists), make sure they are added to the 'chor' list.
5. Run the script `prepdata.py` to prepare the protein sequences and runn HMMer. This script will clean up the data to contain only a single isoform per gene (the longest).

## 1. Find C2H2 motifs in fasta files
Use the script **findmotif.py**. This script will function on a fasta file with protein sequences, where the headers consist of 'geneID|genename|proteinID'. It uses regular expressions to identify possible distinct C2H2 variants in the protein sequence, and cross-matches them with the HMMer results to toss out false positives.

_Customize:_ 
- Adjust the **config.py** file to determine the motifs the script will search for (called 'motiflist').

_Usage:_ `findmotif.py path/to/fastafile`

_Output:_
- In 'sequences':
  - fasta file of protein sequences translated to motif sequences ([fileidentifier]_hmmprotstring.fa).
- In 'databases':
  - fasta file of selected proteins ([fileidentifier]_seq.fa).
  - fasta files with the sequences of all motifs found ([fileidentifier]_hmmallmotifs.fa)
  - individual fasta files per motif
  - all motifs found translated to their string notation ([fileidentifier]_hmmallmotifs.txt), as a total collection of what was found, including ambiguous motifs.
  - a csv database of each protein and locations of detected motifs ([fileidentifier]_hmmhitsdb.csv)
- In 'evolview':
  - a newick file with all motifs (to upload as a new "tree")
  - a heatmap file which shows the frequency of overlap per motif, can be used as heatmap annotation with the above newick file
- In 'images':
  - three bar graphs indicating how many motifs were found per motif type; 'stacked' splits up ambiguous and non-ambiguous; 'non-ambiguous_motifs' only shows non-ambiguous motifs.
  - two heatmaps showing motif overlap; 'singlenorm' only shows normalization over the x axis; 'doublenorm' shows normalization over both axes.
- In 'results':
  - a csv database showing motif overlaps ([fileidentifier]_hmmmotifstats.csv)
  - every time the script is run, two databases will be appended: hitcount_allspp.csv, showing the total numbers of hits per motif, with each file that was run as a new row, and hitcount_allspp-nonambg.csv, showing only non-ambiguous (i.e. non-overlapping) hits.

## 2. Identify orthologs between species
- _NB: this is only useful if in the previous step you have worked with multiple species..._
- Use the script **compara2orths.py**. This script mines ensembl compara (see http://ensemblgenomes.org/info/data/pan_compara) to identify orthologs between the proteins in your database. It saves the identified orthologs to per-species databases in the 'orthologs' folder.
- Before you start, ensure that for each species, only one fasta file exists in the 'sequences' folder (species are identified by a four-character specification; see 0.2).

_Customize:_ 
- NB! When customizing species lists, make sure the list 'chor' in **config.py** contains all the vertebrates in your species list (i.e. those species that ensembl stores in their vertebrate database).
- The script allows download of the compara data to local files; this can be useful if you want to run the script multiple times (mining the database online will take time). In this case, under the heading 'options', set 'saving' to 1 (NB, 'parselocal' should always be set to 0 if you haven't run the 'saving' option yet). Then, for further runs, set 'saving' and 'parseonline' to 0, and 'parselocal' to 1.
For normal runs, it is sufficient to have 'parseonline' to 1 and 'parselocal' and 'saving' to 0.

_Usage:_ `compara2orths.py`

_Output:_
- In 'orthologs':
  - csv databases (one for each species) with all orthologs of proteins of this species found in the other species in use.
- In 'compara' (only if option 'saving' is run):
  - a local copy of the data in the ensemb compara api.

## 3. Determine conservation between orthologs
### 3.1 Separate ortholog pairs into categories.
- To do this, use the script **orthconservation.py**. This script requires the python package 'jellyfish' to be installed.
- The script defines five categories of ortholog pairs:
  - those with identical motif structures
  - those with substitutions only
  - those with structural differences only
  - those with additions/deletions between the pair members
  - other differences (i.e. combinations of the above).
- In addition to separating ortholog pairs into these categories, the script also generates a random motif sequence with each pair (the random sequence is based on one of the members of the pair, but with randomized motifs â€” for details, see the accompanying paper) and runs the comparison again, now separating this random pair into one of the above categories.

_Customize:_
- Specify the **identifier** ('idr') prior to running the script! This is the text preceding your species identification in the original database (see 0.2). For example, with input file _150602-SM00355-xtro_seq.fasta_ the 'idr' text should be _150602-SM00355_. If you don't do this, the script won't be able to locate your files.
- You can customize the species selection in this script, which will cause the script to only use ortholog pairs from the species you selected. The best way to do this is to specify your selection in **config.py** and to refer the variable 'spp' to that selection.
- If you want to compare the results for various species combinations, the script needs to be run separately for every combination.
- In the "options" section, you can adjust the output name as well. Don't forget to do this with each different species combination!

_Usage:_ orthconservation.py

_Output:_
- The results will be printed in the terminal, as well as saved in an output file.
- Some pairs as identified by compara (see 2.) won't exist in your database. These pairs can't be categorized, and are not part of the analysis. These are printed on the terminal as 'not counted'.
- In the folder 'results':
  - A .csv file with the results as printed in the terminal (named _[identifier]-[speciescombination]_orthcomp.csv_)
  - A .csv file with names and motif sequences of the 'identical' and 'substitution' pairs (named _[identifier]-[speciescombination]_orthcomp-detail.csv_)
  - A .csv file with names and motif sequences of the 'identical' and 'substitution' pairs of the random model (named _[identifier]-[speciescombination]_orthcomp-detail-random.csv_)

### 3.2 Compare individual motifs
- To do this, use the script **orthconservation-part2.py**.
- This script uses the 'detailed' ('...-detail.csv') output files from the previous step to identify motifs that can be directly compared. This happens in two ways:
  - Motifs that remain unsubstituted between orthologs are compared amino acid by amino acid.
  - Motifs that are substituted between orthologs are categorized to determine which motifs get substituted by which.

_Customize:_ 
- In the amino acid comparison of unsubstituted motifs, it is possible to only regard ortholog pairs spanning a certain evolutionary distance. This can be specified in the 'list of species for comparison', by defining two groups of species that will only be compared between (i.e. members of group1 with members of group2) but not among (i.e. members of group1 with other members of group1) the groups.

_Usage:_ orthconservation-part2.py path/to/inputfile

_Output:_
- In 'evolview':
  - a heatmap source file that can be used as heatmap annotation with the motif "tree" (generated during step 1), showing which motif types are evolutionarily substituted by which.
  - a bar graph source file that can be used as annotation with the motif "tree" (generated during step 1), which provides the absolute counts for each motif that were assessed during this part of the process (it is a subset, after all).
- In 'images':
  - heatmaps per motif where amino acid substitution is scored. Top row is substitution between amino acids of orthologous motifs; bottom row is comparisons between randomly paired motifs of the same kind. _NB: if this does not appear, check that the species you used are separated into group1 and group2; these comparisons are only made with species combinations where one is part of group1 and the other of group2._
- Prints on terminal the percentage of conserved ambiguous (i.e. overlapping) motifs. _NB: this is different data than is part of the output for 3.3: in this case, the total number of motifs that partake in overlapping motifs are counted (e.g. if motif A overlaps with B on site 1, and in the homologous site of an ortholog motif A and C are found, then this is counted as 4 motifs, of which 2 are conserved)._

### 3.3 Score conservation per motif
- Use the script **orthconservation-part3.py**.
- This script uses the 'detailed' output files from step 3.1 to identify motifs that can be directly compared. It scores substitution similar to the previous step, except it adds up the total number of substitutions per motif, and should be run with both the 'detail.csv' and 'detail-random.csv' files to compare real orthologs with a random model.

_Usage:_ orthconservation-part3.py path/to/inputfile (run separately for each file generated in step 3.1!)

_Output:_
- In 'results':
  - A .csv file with total counts and substitution counts for each motif, as well as ambiguous motifs.
- Print on terminal with that same data.

## 4. Determine the order of motif types
- Use the script **mlocation.py** to determine whether certain motifs are found in the beginning, middle or end of a connected series.

_Usage:_ mlocation.py path/to/inputfile (run separately for each motif sequence â€” result file of findmotif.py â€” or, preferably, on a concatenated version of all result files).

_Output:_
- In 'images':
  - Three .svg images with bar charts plotting the spacing between key amino acids (C-C, C-H, or H-H) to the location of motifs with these properties: either in the beginning, middle, or end of connected series.
  - Three corresponding .csv files with the absolute counts of motifs that were used as the base of this chart (the chart shows percentages only).
